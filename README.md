Coursera.org Meta Marketing Analytics Capstone project

### Background
Hello! We are Inu + Neku and we are a Dog & Cat services and supplies store located in New York City. We just started our e-commerce business and need your help analyzing our data!

Description
We need to make sure the data is clean before starting your analysis. As a reminder, we should check for:

Duplicate records
Consistent formatting
Missing values
Obviously wrong values
NOTE: You can check if your answer is at least close to the correct/expected answer with the check functions (q1_check(), q2_check(), ...). These functions will check your answer and give you some feedback. However, your answer might be incorrect even if the check functions says you're "close" to the expected answer.
